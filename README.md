 Supermarket Customer Churn Analysis

## Introduction

This project analyzes customer data from a supermarket chain to understand factors influencing customer churn. By examining customer demographics, purchase behavior, and loyalty indicators across different branches and product categories, we aim to provide insights that can help improve customer retention strategies.

Churn, or churn rate, is a crucial metric in business, especially in industries with subscription-based models or repeat customers. By analyzing churn, the supermarket can develop strategies to improve customer retention, potentially increasing long-term profitability and customer satisfaction.

## Data Description

The dataset contains 10,000 rows of raw customer data showing detailed information on customer transactions and characteristics, including:

- Customer demographics (age, gender, credit score)
- Membership status and activity
- Transaction details (products purchased, amounts, ratings)
- Branch information
- Churn status

Key fields include:

- `id`: Unique identifier for each transaction
- `branch`: Location of the supermarket (Houston, Dallas, San Antonio)
- `customer_type`: Type of customer (Normal/Member)
- `product_category`: Category of products purchased
- `total_amount`: Total amount of the transaction including tax
- `customer_churn`: Whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0)

## Tools Used

- Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating calculated measures and columns

## Visualization

The project includes a comprehensive Power BI dashboard with two main pages:

1. Overview Page: Provides a high-level summary of key metrics and trends.
2. Customer Churn Analysis Page: Offers detailed insights into churn factors and customer segments.
